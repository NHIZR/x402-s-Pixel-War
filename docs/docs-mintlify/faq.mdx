  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I make profit?">
    When someone conquers your pixel:
    - You receive **110%** of what you paid (your investment + 10% profit)
    - The remaining **10%** goes to the treasury as a platform fee
    - The new price becomes 20% higher for the next conquest
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I recolor my pixels for free?">
    Yes! If you already own a pixel, you can change its color **completely free**. No payment required.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Text Tool

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the Text Tool?">
    The Text Tool lets you convert text into pixel art and draw it on the canvas in one operation. Features include:
    - Full canvas preview (100×56)
    - Drag-and-drop positioning
    - Font size scaling
    - Multiple color options
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What characters are supported?">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between 'Text Only' and 'Full Cover' modes?">
    - **Text Only**: Only conquers the pixels that form the letters
    - **Full Cover**: Conquers both the letters and the background area (rectangular region)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Wallet & Tokens

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which wallets are supported?">
    We support all major Solana wallets:
    - **Phantom** (recommended)
    - **Solflare**
    - **Torus**
    - And other Solana-compatible wallets
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get test USDC?">
    1. Connect your wallet
    2. Click the **"Get USDC"** button in the transaction panel
    3. You'll receive **100 USDC** test tokens
    4. Limit: Once per 24 hours per wallet
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get test SOL for gas fees?">
    1. Click the **"Get SOL"** button
    2. You'll be redirected to the official Solana Faucet
    3. Complete the CAPTCHA verification
    4. Receive 1-5 SOL (Devnet tokens)

    <Note>
    You only need about **0.001 SOL** to cover gas fees for approximately 100 transactions.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does Phantom show 'insufficient SOL' warning?">
    This is a **false warning** from Phantom's pre-check. When claiming USDC for the first time, Phantom may mistakenly think you need to pay for token account creation.

    **Solution**: Safely click **"Confirm anyway"** - the transaction will succeed. Our faucet pays for the token account creation on your behalf.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is my USDC balance showing 0?">
    Possible reasons:
    1. **Haven't claimed yet**: Click "Get USDC" button
    2. **First time**: Token account is being created automatically
    3. **Network delay**: Wait a few seconds, balance refreshes every 30 seconds
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Gameplay Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I select multiple pixels?">
    Hold **Shift** and either:
    - **Click** multiple pixels one by one
    - **Drag** to select a rectangular area

    Press **Esc** to clear selection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the best strategy for beginners?">
    1. Start with **low-priced pixels** (0.01-0.02 USDC) to minimize risk
    2. Use **batch operations** to draw patterns efficiently
    3. Target **active areas** where pixels get conquered frequently
    4. Create **pixel art** to attract attention from other players
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I get a refund?">
    No. All transactions are **final and irreversible**. This is the nature of blockchain transactions. Please conquer carefully!

  <Accordion title="Transaction failed - what should I do?">
    Common causes and solutions:
