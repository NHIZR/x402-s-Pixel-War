## What is x402's Pixel War?

**x402's Pixel War** is a competitive multiplayer experiment that blends collaborative art with GameFi mechanics.

Unlike traditional pixel boards, every pixel here is a **trading market**. Players compete to own pixels on a 50×30 grid, where ownership isn't just about display—it's about profit.

## Powered by PayAI

The game's economy runs on the **X402 Protocol**, a decentralized payment standard built on top of the **PayAI Network**.

*   **PayAI Network**: Provides the underlying infrastructure for seamless, low-latency crypto payments.
*   **X402 Token**: Serves as the native currency for the pixel war, enabling micro-transactions and automated profit distribution without complex wallet interactions.

This integration allows for **instant settlement** and **programmable royalties**, making the dynamic pricing model possible.
