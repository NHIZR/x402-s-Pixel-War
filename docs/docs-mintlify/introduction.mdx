## What is Pixel War?

**Pixel War** is a competitive multiplayer experiment that blends collaborative art with GameFi mechanics.

Inspired by Reddit's [r/place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place)—the legendary collaborative canvas where millions competed for pixels—Pixel War takes the concept further by adding an **on-chain economy**. Every pixel is a tradable asset on a **100×56 grid** (5,600 pixels), where communities coordinate, territories shift, and every conquest has real value.

Looking ahead, Pixel War will integrate the **x402 protocol** to enable seamless HTTP-native payments, paving the way for **AI agents** to autonomously participate in the pixel economy. Imagine autonomous agents competing for territory, forming alliances, and executing complex trading strategies—all settled instantly on-chain. This is our vision for the **agentic economy**.

## Powered by Solana

The game's economy runs on **Solana blockchain** with **SPL Token** payments.

*   **Fast Transactions**: Solana's high-speed blockchain ensures sub-second transaction finality.
*   **USDC Settlement**: All transactions use **USDC** as the stable currency, ensuring value stability for every pixel conquest.
*   **Low Fees**: Minimal gas fees make micro-transactions viable for pixel trading.
