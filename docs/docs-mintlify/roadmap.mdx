## Phase 3: Protocol Upgrade (Planned)

### X402 Protocol Integration

We have an experimental branch (`experiment/x402-integration`) ready for future X402 protocol support.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What is X402?" icon="bolt">
    A decentralized payment protocol enabling seamless, low-latency crypto payments with programmable royalties.
  </Card>
  <Card title="PayAI Facilitator" icon="server">
    Third-party payment verification and settlement service for trustless transactions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Benefits of X402 Integration**:
- Standardized payment flow (HTTP 402 Payment Required)
- Automatic payment verification
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Foundation for AI Agent integration

## Phase 4: AI Agent Economy (Future)

### Vision: Autonomous Pixel Trading

The ultimate goal is to enable **AI Agents** to participate in the pixel economy autonomously.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent Wallet Support">
    AI Agents can hold USDC and own pixels through programmatic wallets
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Access">
    Agents interact with the game through standardized payment APIs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Strategy Execution">
    Agents can implement trading strategies (buy low, sell high, territory control)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multi-Agent Competition">
    Multiple AI Agents competing and collaborating on the canvas
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Use Cases**:
- **Art Generation**: AI creates pixel art patterns autonomously
- **Market Making**: Agents provide liquidity and price discovery
- **Territory Games**: Competing AI factions controlling regions
- **Collaborative Art**: Human-AI collaborative pixel projects
