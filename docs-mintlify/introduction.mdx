# Welcome to x402's Pixel War

## What is x402's Pixel War?

x402's Pixel War is an innovative **blockchain-based pixel conquest game** where players compete to own pixels on a 50×30 grid. Each conquest increases the pixel's price by 20%, creating a dynamic economic system.

## Game Mechanics

### How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use Phantom, Solflare, or Torus wallet
2. **Select Pixels**: Click or drag to select pixels (hold Shift for multi-select)
3. **Pay & Conquer**: Pay the current price in USDC to claim ownership
4. **Earn Profits**: When someone conquers your pixel, you receive 110% back

### Economic Model

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Price Calculation
// Price increases by 20% (×1.2) per conquest
currentPrice = basePrice × (1.2 ** conquestCount);

// Example: After 10 conquests
// 0.01 → 0.012 → 0.0144 → ... → 0.062 USDC
```

```javascript Profit Distribution
// When Alice's pixel (1.0 USDC) is conquered by Bob:
const payment = 1.0;  // Bob pays
const aliceReceives = payment × 1.1;  // 1.1 USDC (110%)
const platformFee = payment × 0.1;     // 0.1 USDC (10% tax)
const newPrice = payment × 1.2;        // 1.2 USDC (new price)

// Alice's profit: 0.1 USDC (10% ROI)
```
